QUESTIONS:

  -where do we need to make notes about cyclic vs. acyclic??
  -Are there any small examples using 3 controllers that do not blow up very large and are easily verifiable? (I'm looking for a good test case)
  -For the observer automaton, if at least one state is marked, does that mean that the entire group of states will be marked in the observer (Figure 2.22 on pg. 89)?

SHORT-TERM:
  
  FINISH NASH THIS WEEKEND:
  -Copy communications over when taking the crush (needs to be implemented)
  -unit/sum/max the costs?????????? Take the crushes to figure out.......... sum and max
  -Add test case for system does not satisfy observability in Nash algorithm (exception handling)
  -Update GUI tooltips for the crush after I recieve a response to my question about copying communications over to the crush
  
  -Ensure that I'm not making the following mistake anywhere: letting two automata share a reference to the same piece of CommunicationData for example.. If one automaton changed it, then it would mess up the other one
  -Add options to generate random automaton:
    observable - build U-structure, ensure there are not any violations
    controllable - there cannot be a bad transition that has an event that is uncontrollable by all controllers
  -finish loading bars when loading automaton
  -Pareto: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/linear.html
  -fix divider issue
  -Nash probability values : feature to automatically distribute? cases where default doesn't add up to 1?)
  -test case for isFeasible() with mustAlsoSolveControlProblem=true
  -Make sure the correct special transitions are being parsed right for each automaton type
  -Add AutomataGUI constants for pop-up widths and heights
  -add more tests for crush (include one which contains loops!)
  -currently regenerating uStructures when clicking "Generate Automaton" button (but they were already generated before when testing for feasibility, so we should store them)
  -In parsing U-Structure GUI input, add validation check for event vectors?
  -add buttons to mark special transitions in GUI? (menu options would work great for this! With checkboxes)
  -parse GUI input differently depending on the type
  -warning message when saving in GUI to overwrite files??
  -option to manually load GUI input code for large automata (alternatively, we could have a screen with automaton stats and list of events, basically everything that is in the header file)
  -What about if multiple AutomataGUI processes are being run at the same time?? Create temporary folder based on PID (NOTE: PID can't easily be found)
  -add export special transitions to file
    checkboxes for the following:
    -add export conditional violations to txt file
    -add export unconditional violations to txt file
    -add export potential communications to txt file
  -4. [Not discussed yet but will come up with Nash] user selects all/any senders and all/any receivers and asks for the quantitatively "cheapest" protocol
  -export to multiple formats at once (and then when user hits exports, let them choose where this file gets copied to)!
  -Add tests to runAutomatonCapacityTestRoutine that check how capacity expanding works
  -add export to png (maybe others?)
  -Add addCommunications test for 3 controllers!!
  -Add test case for accessible, one more test case for union (because I'm not 100% confident in the sets of Events working as expected)
  -In Automaton::addState(), there is the potential for 3 calls to recreateBinaryFile. This should be combined into one call.
  -Allow GUI to resize nicely (and things to be sized automatically better, including pop-ups)

  POTENTIAL:
  -co-acessible warning message if there are no marked states
  -message if no initial state is defined (abort generation of automaton), then we can remove some error-checking in the automaton class (NOTE: This affects a lot of our test cases..)
  -Allow modifications to automaton without regenerating the entire thing (example: adding a state or a transition)
  -Creating observer automaton (p.89) (WIP in GitHub history)
  -Allow user to specify layout mode
  -Zoom feature in image (generate larger image)
  -complement test case (where dump state does not need to be created)
  -Projection operation
