JAVADOC TO-DO LIST:
  
  TestAutomata.java

QUESTIONS:
  -Ask Dr. Ricker what the basic self-loop test case is actually supposed to look like.. Do <a,*> and <*,a> make an upper bound of <a,a>????? Or is a event vector with something in the 0th component, but * in all other components actually an unobservable label?? Can communications be added if n=1?? We can talk about this case on Thursday!
  -Are there any small examples using 3 controllers that do not blow up very large and are easily verifiable? (I'm looking for a good test case)
  -how far into the program can a user get with an uncontrollable system?

SHORT-TERM:
  
  -lemke-howson file input (specify which pivot or specify "ALL")
  -prevent user from adding communications if there was a communication that was a self-loop (display message), this is cyclic vs. acyclic (and add test case for this!) What about INVALID_COMMUNICATIONS that are self-loops?
  -Update tooltips for events in U-struct, pruned, and crush
  -work on shapley values
  -NSGA-II algorithm:
    -Code algorithms 3 and 4
  -Logo
  -add buttons to add events, add states, and add transitions (maybe little plus icons?)
  -add buttons to mark special transitions in GUI? (menu options would work great for this! With checkboxes), specifically marking Bad Transitions is useful
  -deploy as jar

  POTENTIAL/MINOR:
  -warn user when they've specified more than one initial state (only the last one is considered anyway)
  -should the u-structure event properties appear now that we've added them when doing syncrhonized composition?
  -option to manually load GUI input code for large automata (alternatively, we could have a screen with automaton stats and list of events, basically everything that is in the header file)
  -tooltips dissapear when button is clicked
  -Create settings:
    -"overlap=scale;" should be an option for the user since it makes a drastic difference in the output of the graphs
    -open blank automaton tab when program opens (default is yes)
  -File->Open Recent menu (up to 10 most recent items, with separator then "Clear Items" which removes all previous recent items. This button is disabled when there are 0 items)
  -In Automaton::addState(), there is the potential for 3 calls to recreateBinaryFile. This should be combined into one call.
  -Currently regenerating uStructures when clicking "Generate Automaton" button (but they were already generated before when testing for feasibility, so we should store them). NOTE: While this would be more efficient, I do not see a clean way of implementing it
  -Multiple violations on the same transition are not properly drawn in graphviz (we should draw them as two separate transitions)
  -Warning message when saving in GUI to overwrite files
  -There are 3 tooltips left to go in the XML file (from the buttons to generate the image, view image, and generate automaton)
  -Co-acessible warning message if there are no marked states
  -Allow modifications to automaton without regenerating the entire thing (example: adding a state or a transition)
  -What about if multiple JDec processes are being run at the same time?? Create temporary folder based on PID (NOTE: PID can't easily be found)
