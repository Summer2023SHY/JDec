JAVADOC TO-DO LIST:
  
  TestAutomata.java

QUESTIONS:

  -how far into the program can a user get with an uncontrollable system?

SHORT-TERM:
  -crush is generating repeated states (wait for Dr. ricker's reply)
  -manually test when a self-loop communication has been added to U-Structure, try to do nash
  -EVENT: a,FT,TT, STATE: @1, TRANSITION: 1,a,1 (fix U-structure case)
  -when generating U-Structure, display warning if there are any unmarked states (we are assuming pre-fixed closed)
  -hasViolations() doesn't need to care about conditional violations (any implications??)
  -work on shapley values
  -GUI Tests?? - http://abbot.sourceforge.net/doc/quick-start.shtml
  -what happens if a bad transition is a self-loop??
  -NSGA-II algorithm:
    -Code algorithms 3 and 4
  -add buttons to mark special transitions in GUI? (menu options would work great for this! With checkboxes), specifically marking Bad Transitions is useful
  -Documentation for each operation on website
  -http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/private-fields-and-methods.html

POTENTIAL/MINOR:

  -find counter-example for Dr. ricker
  -prevent user from picking the label reserved for the dump state in the complement operation
  -why are Events in a set instead of a map??????? unqiueness is already being guaranteed by JDec
  -add buttons to add events, add states, and add transitions (maybe little plus icons?)
  -warn user when they've specified more than one initial state (only the last one is considered anyway)
  -tooltips dissapear when button is clicked
  -In Automaton::addState(), there is the potential for 3 calls to recreateBinaryFile. This should be combined into one call.
  -Currently regenerating uStructures when clicking "Generate Automaton" button (but they were already generated before when testing for feasibility, so we should store them). NOTE: While this would be more efficient, I do not see a clean way of implementing it
  -Multiple violations on the same transition are not properly drawn in graphviz (we should draw them as two separate transitions). Is it even possible for multiple violations to be in the same place??
  -Warning message when saving in GUI to overwrite files
  -There are 3 tooltips left to go in the XML file (from the buttons to generate the image, view image, and generate automaton)
  -Co-acessible warning message if there are no marked states
  -Allow modifications to automaton without regenerating the entire thing (example: adding a state or a transition)
  -What about if multiple JDec processes are being run at the same time?? Create temporary folder based on PID (NOTE: PID can't easily be found)
