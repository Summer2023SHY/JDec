TO-DO:

  -fix observability test to account for cases where a controller can disable an event due to the prefix it has observed so far
  -how does the GUI handle duplicate transitions??
  -add test case for myerson values
  -finish implementing myerson values
  -add 'busy cursor' in operations which do not have some other kind of progress indicator
  -change JDec back from twin plant to complement
  -if twin plant operation stays, make sure it works well with the complement operation (since they both use a dump state), it likely shouldn't remain in the GUI anyway

    -Code algorithms 3 and 4
  -Warning message when saving in GUI to overwrite files
  -test how far into the program can a user get with an uncontrollable system?
  -Documentation for each operation on website
